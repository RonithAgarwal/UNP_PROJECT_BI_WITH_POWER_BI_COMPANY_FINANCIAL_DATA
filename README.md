# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA 

As part of a value-added course with UNP Education, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a companyâ€™s financial dataset using Power BI, focusing on key business metrics such as sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, the impact of discounts, and product performance. My analysis revealed a remarkable 249.46% profit growth, driven by various factors including increased sales, pricing adjustments, and shifts in demand. However, I also identified variations in profit margins across different regions, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies to maximize profitability. Additionally, my study showed that while discounts played a role in boosting sales, excessive discounting on certain products led to profit erosion, emphasizing the need for a more targeted and data-driven discounting approach. Furthermore, an evaluation of high and low-margin products revealed that some low-margin products, despite strong sales, negatively impacted overall profitability, whereas high-margin products contributed significantly to business growth. Based on these insights, I proposed strategic recommendations to optimize key business operations, including refining pricing strategies through dynamic and value-based pricing, implementing a more structured discounting model to maintain profit margins, enhancing inventory management by leveraging demand forecasting to reduce overstocking and stockouts, and expanding sales efforts in high-growth regions to capitalize on existing market opportunities. This analysis demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making using Power BI, providing actionable insights that can help the company achieve sustainable long-term growth through strategic financial and operational improvements.
